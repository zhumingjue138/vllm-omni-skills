# vLLM-Omni PR Review

## Overview

Use this skill as a router for `vllm-project/vllm-omni` pull request reviews. Keep the default context small, load only the references that match the diff, and prioritize high-confidence findings over coverage theater.

Default review priorities:

1. Missing regression or integration tests
2. Claims without evidence
3. Security or reliability regressions
4. Breaking API or behavior changes
5. Architecture flaws in critical paths

## Core Workflow

### Step 0: Verify Review Gates First

Check mergeability and required checks before reading the diff in depth. If DCO, pre-commit, or mergeability is failing, stop and ask the author to fix the gate before doing a full review.

For concrete gate commands, review submission commands, and comment style, see [references/review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md).

### Step 1: Gather Minimal Context

Fetch:

- PR metadata and changed files
- The diff
- Linked issues for `[Bugfix]` and `[Feature]` PRs
- Related PRs only when conventions or prior decisions are unclear

Do not fetch broad extra context unless the diff or linked issue leaves real ambiguity.

### Step 2: Route to the Right Skill

Use the title prefix and changed directories to decide whether a domain skill is required.

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `[Model]`, `[New Model]`, `[Image]`, `[ImageGen]`, `[Video]`, `[VideoGen]`, `[Diffusion]` | → [Diffusion Model PR Review](#diffusion-model-pr-review) |
| `[Audio]`, `[TTS]` | Use `vllm-omni-audio-tts` |
| `[Multimodal]` | Use `vllm-omni-multimodal` |
| `[Distributed]` | Use `vllm-omni-distributed` |
| `[Quantization]` | Use `vllm-omni-quantization` |
| `[Performance]` | Use `vllm-omni-perf` |
| `[Hardware]` or backend-specific code | Use `vllm-omni-hardware` |
| `[API]` or `vllm_omni/entrypoints/` changes | Use `vllm-omni-api` |
| `[CI]` | Use `vllm-omni-cicd` |

If the PR spans multiple specialized areas, choose the primary skill first and load a secondary skill only when the diff crosses a real subsystem boundary.

For multi-skill routing, hardware detection, and delegation rules, see [references/review-routing.md](references/review-routing.md).

### Step 3: Load Only the Relevant Review Reference

Load targeted references based on the diff:

| Diff Area | Load |
|-----------|------|
| `vllm_omni/engine/`, `vllm_omni/stages/`, `vllm_omni/connectors/`, `vllm_omni/diffusion/` | [references/pitfalls.md](references/pitfalls.md) |
| Async, distributed coordination, validation, connector behavior | [references/code-patterns.md](references/code-patterns.md) |
| Scheduler, stage boundaries, execution model, critical paths | [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md) |

Avoid loading all three by default. Start with the one that matches the changed files or the most likely failure mode.

### Step 4: Run the Critical Checks

Apply these checks to every substantive PR:

- Is there a regression test for bug fixes?
- Do new features include tests and docs where needed?
- Are performance claims backed by benchmark data?
- Are API or config changes validated early and documented?
- Does the change preserve cleanup, state transitions, and distributed invariants?

If a finding is speculative, do not comment. Fetch a bit more code context first or drop it.

### Step 5: Keep the Output Tight

Comment only on blocking or high-value issues. Combine related problems into a single comment when possible, and avoid praise-only or low-signal remarks. Small documentation-only PRs often need no inline comments.

Use the review body to summarize:

- what you validated
- what still lacks evidence
- what must change before approval

For comment budget, phrasing, examples, and posting mechanics, see [references/review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md).

## Review Heuristics

- Treat missing tests as the default highest-priority issue.
- Demand measurements for performance, memory, or quality claims.
- Be suspicious of silent fallbacks, swallowed exceptions, and device-specific assumptions.
- Review critical paths first: engine, model executor, connectors, stages, and API entrypoints.
- Skip nits, style comments, and linter-covered feedback unless they hide a correctness issue.

## When to Fetch More Context

Fetch more code or issue context when:

- the diff snippet hides lifecycle or cleanup behavior
- a config key or API field is introduced without nearby validation
- a benchmark or quality claim references unseen measurement code
- the PR appears to rely on prior design discussion

Keep additional fetches narrow and tied to a specific uncertainty.

## Diffusion Model PR Review

> **Invoked when PR prefix is `[Model]`, `[New Model]`, `[Image]`, `[ImageGen]`, `[Video]`, `[VideoGen]`, or `[Diffusion]`.**

All four dimensions below must pass before approving. Work through them in priority order. See [references/diffusion-checklist.md](references/diffusion-checklist.md) for full per-item criteria across all dimensions.

### Priority Order

1. **PR body evidence** — missing samples/metrics block the entire review
2. **Missing inference mode** — model must work offline and online
3. **Missing acceleration feature** — required for all new diffusion models
4. **Missing memory optimization** — required for all new diffusion models
5. **Missing documentation** — tables and examples must be updated
6. **Missing e2e test** — required for merge gate
7. **Missing offline inference test** — recommended; required only when no e2e test is present
8. **Combined feature test** — required when two or more acceleration/memory features are implemented

---

### Dimension 1: PR Body Completeness

Required: generation script, sample outputs, e2e latency, peak VRAM. Recommended: matching diffusers baseline for all four.

**Comment when required items are missing:**

```
🔴 **PR Body Incomplete — Required Evidence Missing**

The following items are required before this PR can be reviewed:

- [ ] vLLM-Omni generation script (offline `Omni` or online `vllm serve`)
- [ ] Generated sample output (image / video / audio)
- [ ] vLLM-Omni e2e latency (hardware: GPU model, count; resolution; steps)
- [ ] vLLM-Omni peak VRAM usage (GB)

Please update the PR description with this information.
```

**Comment when diffusers baseline is absent:**

```
💡 **Recommended: diffusers Baseline Comparison**

Adding a diffusers comparison would strengthen this PR:

- diffusers generation script (same prompt, same resolution/steps)
- diffusers sample output
- diffusers e2e latency vs vLLM-Omni latency
- diffusers peak VRAM vs vLLM-Omni VRAM
```

### Dimension 2: Code Review

```bash
# Detect leftover diffusers mixins
gh pr diff <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  | grep '^\+' | grep -E 'DiffusionPipelineMixin|SchedulerMixin|ConfigMixin'

# Check acceleration features
gh pr diff <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  | grep -iE 'sequence_parallel|cfg_parallel|vae_patch_parallel|tensor_parallel|teacache|cache_dit'

# Check memory optimizations
gh pr diff <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  | grep -iE 'cpu_offload|offload_to_cpu|quantization|int8|fp8|bitsandbytes|vae_tiling'
```

**2.1 Inference modes** — both offline (`Omni`) and online (`vllm serve` / `AsyncOmni`) must be implemented.

```
🔴 Missing <offline inference / online serving> support. The model must work in both
Omni (offline) and vllm serve / AsyncOmni (online) modes before merging.
```

**2.2 Diffusers mixin cleanup** — flag any mixin still present in `+` lines.

```
🔴 Leftover diffusers mixin detected: `<MixinName>` in `<file>:<line>`.
Remove diffusers mixins and use vLLM-Omni's native abstractions instead.
```

**2.3 Acceleration features** — at least one of: sequence parallel, CFG parallel, VAE patch parallel, tensor parallel, TeaCache/step cache.

```
🔴 No acceleration feature detected. The model must support at least one of:
sequence parallel, CFG parallel, VAE patch parallel, tensor parallel, or step caching (TeaCache).
```

**2.4 Memory optimization** — at least one of: CPU offload, quantization (int8/fp8/bnb), VAE tiling.

```
🔴 No memory optimization feature detected. The model must support at least one of:
CPU offload (`--cpu-offload-gb`), quantization (int8/fp8/bnb), or VAE tiling.
```

---

### Dimension 3: Documentation

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep -E 'docs/|\.md$'
```

Required: model support table, feature support table, usage example doc (offline + online).

```
🔴 Documentation incomplete:
- [ ] Model support table not updated (docs/models/supported_models.md or equivalent)
- [ ] Feature support table not updated
- [ ] Usage example doc missing or not updated for <ModelName>
```

---

### Dimension 4: Test Coverage

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep -E '^tests/'
```

Required: e2e online serving test. Recommended: offline inference test. Required when 2+ features: combined feature test.

```
🔴 Missing e2e online serving test in `tests/e2e/online_serving/`.
Please add a test that:
1. Starts `vllm serve <model> --omni`
2. Sends a generation request via the API
3. Asserts the response contains a valid image / video / audio output
```

```
⚠️ Multiple features are implemented (e.g., <feature A> + <feature B>) but no combined
feature test is present. Please add a test (or extend the e2e test) that enables both
features together and asserts output validity + reports latency + VRAM.
```
