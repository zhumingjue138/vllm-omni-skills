# vLLM-Omni Quantization

## Overview

Use this skill for `vllm-omni` quantization work. Quantization work in this codebase splits into two distinct paths:

- AR and omni-model quantization inherited from upstream `vllm`
- diffusion quantization for DiT models in `vllm-omni`, currently `fp8` and `gguf`

Core principle: keep generic quantization infrastructure in upstream `vllm`. Keep `vllm-omni` focused on diffusion-specific config glue, model wiring, adapter logic, and verification.

## Quick Decision

| Task | Use |
|------|-----|
| Quantize Qwen-Omni, Qwen-TTS, or another AR-backed model | `references/methods.md` and `references/modality-compat.md` |
| Reduce KV cache memory | `references/methods.md` |
| Quantize diffusion transformer weights with `fp8` or `gguf` | `references/diffusion.md` |
| Add a diffusion method such as `int8` or `nvfp4` | `references/diffusion.md` |
| Unsure whether a change belongs in `vllm` or `vllm-omni` | `references/diffusion.md` |

## When to Use

- Choosing a quantization method for memory or throughput
- Checking whether a modality or model family actually supports quantization
- Enabling diffusion `fp8` or `gguf`
- Adding a new diffusion quantization method
- Debugging quantized loading, tensor-name mapping, shape mismatch, quality drift, or performance regressions

## AR vs Diffusion Boundary

- AR quantization usually means upstream `vllm` methods such as `awq`, `gptq`, `fp8`, and KV-cache FP8.
- Diffusion quantization means `vllm-omni` DiT-specific integration and should not duplicate upstream `vllm` kernels or config semantics.

Rule: if a new method is missing generic kernels, loader behavior, or config classes, fix upstream `vllm` first. Only add a thin diffusion wrapper in `vllm-omni`.

## Common Mistakes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| `quantization` flag has no visible effect | wrong model stage or unsupported modality | check `references/modality-compat.md` |
| AR model quality drops too much | aggressive 4-bit setup or wrong method | check calibration and method tradeoffs in `references/methods.md` |
| diffusion method works on one image only | no baseline comparison or controlled verification | use fixed-seed BF16 comparison from `references/diffusion.md` |
| GGUF mapping fails | missing architecture-specific adapter | add explicit adapter logic, do not rely on generic fallback |
| new diffusion method design keeps growing | upstream/downstream boundary is unclear | re-check ownership before touching model code |
