## PR Tests & Docs Review Addendum

This reference adds two structured outputs for `vllm-omni-review`:

- Coverage matrix (change point → existing tests → gap → minimal fix)
- PR description checklist (environment + runtime estimate + fill-in template)

### 1) Coverage Matrix (required for high-risk changes)

Use this format. Keep it short and actionable.

- Change point:
  - What changed:
  - Risk if broken:
  - Where it lives (paths/modules):
- Existing tests:
  - Unit tests:
  - E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`):
  - Example/gate tests (if any):
- Gaps:
  - Missing behavior coverage:
  - Missing failure/boundary case:
  - Missing regression (for bugfix):
- Minimal add:
  - Suggested test file(s):
  - Suggested test cases (1–3 bullets):
  - Suggested assertions (stable, deterministic):

### 2) Style / Tag / Stability Checklist (quick pass)

- Markers/labels follow repository CI docs and are justified (no marker sprawl).
- Assertions are stable (avoid external network/time/randomness).
- Numeric assertions avoid direct float `==` / `!=` and use tolerances/approx checks.
- Test names and failure messages are readable and help locate the issue quickly.

### 3) Docs Sync Checklist (examples ↔ docs)

- If `examples/` README/docs were changed, ensure the corresponding `docs/` entry points are updated (avoid stale user-facing docs), if not, tell user using `mkdocs serve` to sync the updates from `examples`  to `docs`.
- If a new model/feature/parameter/default changed, ensure `vllm-omni/docs` includes:
  - What it is / how to use
  - Constraints and known limitations
  - Minimal runnable example (when appropriate)

### 4) PR Description Checklist (environment + runtime)

Ensure the PR description includes:

- Required hardware/environment:
  - CPU/GPU type, VRAM, CUDA/driver (or ROCm/NPU/XPU), OS
  - Python/vllm/vllm-omni version, key package versions (if relevant)
- What was run:
  - Commands (exact)
  - Expected outputs (brief)
- Runtime estimate:
  - Rough duration (order of magnitude is enough)

Fill-in template (2–3 lines):

```
Test env: <CPU/GPU + VRAM>, <CUDA/driver>, <OS>, Python <ver>
Commands: <cmd1>; <cmd2>
Runtime: ~<N> min
```
